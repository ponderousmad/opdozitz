Keeping this branch around to mark the last XNA version of the game:

Originally concieved as part of the 'Opposites' themed Reddit Game Jam.

Basically you need to shepard a bunch of dumb rolling robots along platforms by moving them into a continous path.

The trick is that the robots can roll along both tops and bottoms of platforms.

Implemented using XNA 3.1
