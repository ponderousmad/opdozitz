# opdozitz

Originally concieved as part of the 'Opposites' themed Reddit Game Jam.

Basically you need to shepard a bunch of dumb rolling robots along platforms by moving them into a continous path.

The trick is that the robots can roll along both tops and bottoms of platforms.

Recently ported to HTML/canvas.

Feel free to [give it a try!](http://ponderousmad.com/opdozitz/game.html)
